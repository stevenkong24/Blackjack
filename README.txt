This is a personal project I had made around February 2021. Though it is fully
functional, it is not to the level I had wanted it to be. I was not able to
finish it due to having school projects to work on. It is not complete but some
changes I had wanted to make was to make it work for multiple decks, allow 
many games without rerunning, having a currency system with customizable wagers,
the ability to save and load games, and allowing for a user to double down or 
buy insurance. Anyways thank you for downloading it and I hope you like it! :)
